# Everyday Hacks
**some hacker scripts/modules for everyday needs**

This is a collection of various scripts written in Python that makes my day to day tasks easier. If you are a lazy programmer (like me) and want things done just with a single command from your command prompt (or terminal), this repository is for you. Just don't forget to 🌟 the repo. 

If you found this repository helpful, please consider buying me a coffee. Thanks!<br>
